# Workspace Creator
## About
Workspace creator is a simple VS Code Extension that I created to setup a web-workspace.
You can find it on the Visual Studio Marketplace when you search for 'Workspace Creator'.

## Features
This is a simple extension that creates a basic web-workspace, it creates several files / folders in the current workspace. The files it will create are:

```
./css/style.css
./js/main.js
./index.html
```

The stylesheet and javascript file will both be linked in the index.html.

## Usage
1. Make sure you have a workspace opened
2. Open the command Palette with: `Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`
3. Type Workspace Creator: `Create new Workspace`
4. Finished!
